# OAuth Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Created OAuth Utility Functions (`src/utils/auth.ts`)
- ✅ Implemented `signInWithGoogle()` function with proper error handling
- ✅ Implemented `signInWithGitHub()` function with proper error handling
- ✅ Added session management functions
- ✅ Added sign out functionality
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types integration

### 2. Updated Auth Modal Component (`src/components/auth-modal.tsx`)
- ✅ Replaced simulated social auth with real Supabase OAuth calls
- ✅ Added loading states for OAuth buttons
- ✅ Added error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Improved user experience with loading indicators

### 3. Updated Type Definitions (`src/types/supabase.ts`)
- ✅ Added OAuth provider types
- ✅ Added AuthError and AuthResult interfaces
- ✅ Proper TypeScript integration across components

## 🔄 Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify Supabase OAuth configuration in dashboard
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are set correctly:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] Configure OAuth providers in Supabase:
  - Google OAuth app credentials
  - GitHub OAuth app credentials

### 2. Testing OAuth Flow
- [ ] Test Google OAuth integration
- [ ] Test GitHub OAuth integration
- [ ] Verify redirect handling works properly
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network issues)
- [ ] Test auth state persistence across browser sessions

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify auth modal opens/closes correctly
- [ ] Test loading states during OAuth process
- [ ] Verify error messages display properly
- [ ] Test complete user journey from login to dashboard

### 4. Edge Cases
- [ ] Test OAuth with existing user accounts
- [ ] Test OAuth with new user registration
- [ ] Verify proper session management
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Test auth state recovery on page refresh

## 📋 Prerequisites for Testing

Before testing can begin, ensure:

1. **Supabase Configuration:**
   - OAuth providers are enabled in Supabase dashboard
   - Redirect URLs are configured correctly
   - Environment variables are set in `.env.local`

2. **OAuth App Setup:**
   - Google OAuth app is created and configured
   - GitHub OAuth app is created and configured
   - Callback URLs point to your application

3. **Development Server:**
   - Application is running on development server
   - Supabase local development is running (if using local Supabase)

## 🚀 How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the application in browser

3. Click "Get Started" to open auth modal

4. Test OAuth buttons:
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Click "Continue with GitHub"

5. Verify:
   - Loading states appear
   - Redirect to OAuth provider works
   - User is redirected back to dashboard
   - Auth state is properly managed

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

- OAuth flow requires proper Supabase configuration
- Make sure redirect URLs match your development environment
- Test in incognito mode to avoid cached sessions
- Check browser console for any OAuth-related errors
